abstract: The impact of teaching versus nonteaching services on outcomes and resource use in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is unknown. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of an internal medicine teaching service compared to a nonteaching service on outcomes and resource use in patients admitted with AECOPD in a community teaching hospital.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A retrospective cohort study of patients admitted for a primary diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation to Florida Hospital Orlando, a large community teaching hospital, between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2014. Data were extracted from Premier administrative database. Risk adjusted length of stay (LOS), cost of hospitalization, 30‚Äêday readmissions, and mortality rate were measured. Risk adjustment for outcomes was based on Premier CareScience methodology.
