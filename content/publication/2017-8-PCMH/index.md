abstract: As of April 2015, less than 10% of Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizations (MSSP ACOs) included Rural Health Clinics (RHCs). In order to understand why RHCs are not participating in this ACO model in greater numbers, this study examined the influence of several factors on ACO participation. Data for this study were collected via a survey distributed during the summers of 2012, 2013, and 2014 to all RHCs in 9 states. This study had a cross-sectional design using survey research. The unit of analysis was the RHC; the total sample size was 178. This study found that those respondents who reported knowing very little about ACOs had the lowest “willingness to join an ACO” score and that the passage of time increased RHC willingness to join an ACO. Also, patient-centered medical home (PCMH) recognition was the most influential factor related to an RHC's adopting the ACO model. If ACO model adoption is to increase in rural areas, this study suggests that strategies would need to include methods for (1) targeting RHCs that have PCMH recognition; (2) increasing PCMH recognition in rural areas; and (3) increasing RHC knowledge about what an ACO is, how the model works, and why this model may benefit RHCs and other rural primary care providers.
