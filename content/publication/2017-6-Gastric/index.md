abstract: There are currently no evidence-based guidelines on the routine or selective use of radiologic imaging after omental patch repair (OPR) of a gastric (GP) or duodenal perforation (DP). This study aims to elucidate whether the use of selective or routine contrast upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) postoperatively will significantly increase the rate of missed leaks or lead to worse clinical outcomes.
