**Curiosity**

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/Maz1hoeGskARW/giphy.gif)

I've been always a person with a curious mind that constantly seaerches and looks things around. The wonder of history and the future, questionning on information on the insight drives me to the field of Statistics. I didn't choose this field but accidentally inspired to be in the field. It was difficult for me to understand all the mathmatics and it's still difficult till this day. But the more I know, the better I understand that how much I don't know. 

**Powerlessness**

Being pressured to achieve in this world from society has always made me self doubt. Accepting the truth of human weakness and knowing that I'm not perfect and I don't need to be perfect helps me to identify myself and be humble. Data Science is the emerging field that requries multidisciplinary knowledge and at the mean time creates different level of opportunities for everyone. You don't need a fancy PhD to be a Data Scientist. The unique background and learning apitude makes a better scientist. Embracing the powerlessness as a human is the power that drives people to grow in a healthy way.

**Compassion**

The wilingness to make a better decision and to make a better world through love and passion pushes me to go over the limit and move forward. Our daily life is affected by technology heavily. and there are still a lot challenges that we want to make a improvement on. My grandma on my dad side passed away from stamoch cancer, my grandma on my mom side passed away from acute pancreatitis. It was a tough time for me to watch my grandma in the ICU and breathed on the ventilation machine. I had the fear of being in the hospital and somehow I ended up in healthcare research and work now as a Biostatistician in the hospital. My knowledge of medicine and healthcare over the years has increased dramatically and there is still so much to learn even just on the superficial terminology, not to mention the clinical process, insurance, etc.
