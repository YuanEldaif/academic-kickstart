  Recently, I discovered a few pretty cool tools, R-based and easy to follow.

- **R Presentation Themes**

  +  Why uses R presentation?
      1.  **Take advantage of R Markdown.** You can write all your slides in Markdown text
      2.  **Power of interchange.** You can include chunks of R code and rendered output like plots, results, tables, etc. in your slides
      3.  **Version control and sharing.** You can use git for version control and share your GitHub repository

  +  My current favorate [**Xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Themes) [nanja-theme](https://github.com/emitanaka/ninja-theme) was developed by Emi Tanaka.


- **Data Cleaning/Data Wrangling tool kit - Tidyverse**

  +  **Book** [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham.


  +  **Visual** Data cleaning post- [Tidyverse overview](https://jules32.github.io/2016-07-12-Oxford/dplyr_tidyr/#3_tidyr_overview) by Julia Stewart Lowndes.


*I'm working on an advanced statistical class "Significance Test" by using R presentation and will share the code on Github. 
<br/>so stay tuned...*
