# R Markdown

The first time that I used R Markdown was back to 2014 when I was in graduate school. Unfortunately, I haven't used this as much as I would like to due to the inconvinience with IT in the hospital. I'm slowly trying to use Rstudio more and more as SAS has limited options on some analysis. R markdown is great for documenting R code and math expressions.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:


```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```

# Including Flow Chart

You can embed a flow chart. See Figure \@ref(fig:flow) for example:

```{r flow, fig.cap='A flow chart.', tidy=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

# define the global styles of the nodes. We can override these in box if we wish

node [shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = Linen]
First [label =  '1. \n Create \n Github Repository']
Second [label = '2. \n Create R blogdown \n in R Studio']
Third [label= '3. \n Deploy the web \n by Netlify']

# edge definitions with the node IDs
First -> Second -> Third
}", height=150)
```
