#P-value

###- P-value or significance is a probability, thus bounded by 0 and 1. 

--
###- A test p-value provides the probability indicating statistical significance.

--
###- If the p-value is less than 0.05 (typically used value for statistical testing), then the study results are statistically significant.

--
<br>
###.yellow[**Note**] There is an ongoing debate on miss-using p-value. and New England Jounal of Medicine in July,2019 published the [new Statistical Reporting Guidelines](https://www.nejm.org/author-center/new-manuscripts).

# Hypothesis
<br>
###- Null hypothesis (H0): Assumption of the test holds and is failed to be rejected at some level of significance.

###**Example**: suppose someone claims that 20 (80%) of 25 patients who received drug A were cured, compared to 12 (48%) of 25 patients who received drug B. 

--
###- H0: the two treatments are equally effective and the observed difference arose by chance
<br>
###- H1: one treatment is better than the other.

###.white[Side note:] However, it is essential to note that the P value does not provide a direct answer. Let us assume in this case the statistician does a significance test and gets a P value = .04, meaning that the difference is statistically significant (P < .05). But as explained earlier, this does not mean that there is a 4% probability that the null hypothesis is true and 96% chance that the alternative hypothesis is true. The P value is a frequential probability and it provides the information that there is a 4% probability of obtaining such a difference between the cure rates, if the null hypothesis is true. 

<br>
###In probability, this would be written as follows:

###P(p1^=p1.red[/H0])

##**Assumptions for parametric test:**
<br>
###- Sample is derived from a population with a normal distribution.- a “bell-shaped curve.” 
####(The sample size is large enough for the central limit theorem to lead to normality of averages) 

###- Variance is homogeneous.

###- Data are measured at interval level.

##**Assumptions for nonparametric test is not free:**
<br>
###- Distinctly non-normal and cannot be transformed
